        <p>Although I enjoy managing projects, coming up with unique solutions and juggling applications and resources, I specialize in front-end development.</p>
        <p>I enjoy different platforms and frameworks, as I believe each can offer a unique solution for each project. I've made it my goal to master several. Check out some examples of each.</p>

        <h2>BZ Frontend Library</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/code.jpg" alt="BZ library codebase" class="left-image" />
        <p>A collection, or library, of frontend assets used to standardize markup and naming conventions on the frontend. Utilizing various, commonly used pieces of markup, like multiple levels and styles of navigation, column structure, footers and more, the BZ (Be Easy) Library is designed to help designers as well as programmers create easy, consistent markup for their projects.</p>
        <p>There are currently no examples, as this Library is still undergoing its final stages before coming to life. The library is a symfony-based tool that will soon be stand-alone.</p>

        <h2>Magento Commerce</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/magento.jpg" alt="Magento Commerce" class="left-image" />
        <p>Magento is an open source e-commerce platform built on the ZEND Framework that is quickly becoming the go-to source for e-commerce. Having used other carting systems in the past, such as ZendCart, I quickly jumped on the opportunity to try out Magento. It gives the flexibility of a wonderful framework with its tools and options, as well as the stability and security. Its easily editable markup and XML driven structure have it set up in way that I could create my own theme, and move it from place to place with only necessary markup changes.</p>

        <h2>Symfony</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/symfony.jpg" alt="Symfony" class="left-image" />
        <p>Having worked at iostudio under the direction of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ryan+weaver+web+development&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Ryan Weaver</a>, Symfony became a natural part of my day-to-day development. Symfony is a powerful framework with a write-less, do more attitude. Learning Symfony has helped me to utilize more PHP in ways to write less, yet more efficient, code.</p>
        <p><a href="symfony" class="linkrel">Examples</a></p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>WordPress</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/wordpress.jpg" alt="WordPress" class="left-image border" />
        <p>Love it or hate it, clients get the most out of my custom WordPress theme. Using Google-style searching, with the "did you mean <i>thoughts</i>?", custom comments, Google sitemaps, caching for large blogs and other techniques, my custom theme and its foreign to WordPress clean code, will have clients adding page specific menu items and editing custom areas of their site in no time.</p>
        <p><a href="wordpress" class="linkrel">Examples</a></p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Zend</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/zend.jpg" alt="Zend" class="left-image border" />
        <p>While Symfony is my number one choice, I've had the opportunity to do front-end for Path to Honor, the National Guard's recruiting and management system on the Zend Framework. Magento is also built on the Zend Framework.</p>
        <p>Due to restrictions, no examples available.</p>

        <h2>Various</h2>
        <img src="/images/work/various.jpg" alt="Various web images" class="left-image" />
        <p>Aside from a skill-set in major tools, I've done some pretty cool various projects. I've done front-end for BWA, Ltd., the archietects responsibily for most of Las Vegas, set up a CrowdFlower API for Bizooki, a new media and digital marketing firm to be able to track outsourcing time, and created fan clubs for Atlantic Record's artists Gavin DeGraw and Fall Out Boy.</p>

With custom pricing and discounts per login and category specific products, this site called for a custom theme and setup. 4Walls is also set up to reuse their product database for future B2C sites.</p>
