    <p>It all started when my father and uncle bought the boar hunting acreage back in 1964. In 1995, we were fortunate enough to acquire a beautiful neighboring parcel. This second tract provides the perfect setting for ram and bison hunting.</p>
    <p>I grew up right here in Cumberland County, born into a family of avid hunters. So I've been spending time in these woods since I was knee-high. Cheri and Susie, officially known as the office staff, are also family members. Like me, they've been with the Lodge since day one. If you have a question or want to make a reservation, any of us will be happy to help.</p>
    <p>Expert guides Mike, Heath and Marty aren't family strictly speaking, but might as well be. They're very familiar with the local terrain and wildlife, having lived and hunted around here for years. All three are really nice guys, and each is extremely knowledgeable about firearm use and safety.</p>
    <p>Together, we all work hard to make sure every visitor experiences the hunt of a lifetime. Maybe that explains why so many customers return year after year.
