    <p>Every Sabre product is the sum of superior materials, precision engineering and painstaking quality control, fueled by uncompromising passion. No wonder our single largest client is also known as the industry's most demanding: it is our honor and privilege to have been selected as a supplier to the United States government. If you see U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world using a Browning M2 caliber machine gun, 7.62 mm mini-gun or M16 rifle, chances are very good you're seeing Sabre products in action.</p>
